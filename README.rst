X-Ray Timing Made Easy
=======================

We are writing a general-purpose timing package for X-ray time series.

Contents
--------

The contents will be:

- make a light curve from event data
- make periodograms in Leahy and rms normalization
- average periodograms
- cross spectra and lags (time vs energy, time vs frequency)
- maximum likelihood fitting of periodograms/parametric models
- bispectra (?)
- cross correlation functions, coherence
- spectral-timing functionality
- Bayesian QPO searches
- power colours
- rms spectra
- astroquery interface with RXTE, Astrosat, NICER (these modules need to get built too)
