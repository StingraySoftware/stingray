        Make a light curve object from an array of time stamps and an
        array of counts.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time: iterable
            A list or array of time stamps for a light curve

        counts: iterable, optional, default None
            A list or array of the counts in each bin corresponding to the
            bins defined in `time` (note: **not** the count rate, i.e.
            counts/second, but the counts/bin).

        input_counts: bool, optional, default True
            If True, the code assumes that the input data in 'counts'
            is in units of counts/bin. If False, it assumes the data
            in 'counts' is in counts/second.

        Attributes
        ----------
        time: numpy.ndarray
            The array of midpoints of time bins

        counts: numpy.ndarray
            The counts per bin corresponding to the bins in `time`.

        countrate: numpy.ndarray
            The counts per second in each of the bins defined in `time`.

        ncounts: int
            The number of data points in the light curve.

        dt: float
            The time resolution of the light curve.

        tseg: float
            The total duration of the light curve.

        tstart: float
            The start time of the light curve.

        Parameters
        ----------
