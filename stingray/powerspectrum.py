def classical_pvalue(power, nspec):
    """
    Compute the probability of detecting the current power under
    the assumption that there is no periodic oscillation in the data.

    This computes the single-trial p-value that the power was
    observed under the null hypothesis that there is no signal in
    the data.

    Important: the underlying assumptions that make this calculation valid
    are:
    (1) the powers in the power spectrum follow a chi-square distribution
    (2) the power spectrum is normalized according to Leahy (1984), such
    that the powers have a mean of 2 and a variance of 4
    (3) there is only white noise in the light curve. That is, there is no
    aperiodic variability that would change the overall shape of the power
    spectrum.

    Also note that the p-value is for a *single trial*, i.e. the power currently
    being tested. If more than one power or more than one power spectrum are
    being tested, the resulting p-value must be corrected for the number
    of trials (Bonferroni correction).

    Mathematical formulation in Groth, 1975.
    Original implementation in IDL by Anna L. Watts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    power :  float
        The squared Fourier amplitude of a spectrum to be evaluated

    nspec : int
        The number of spectra or frequency bins averaged in `power`.
        This matters because averaging spectra or frequency bins increases
        the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. makes the statistical distributions
        of the noise narrower, such that a smaller power might be very
        significant in averaged spectra even though it would not be in a single
        power spectrum.

        Note that this function will *only* produce correct results when the
        following underlying assumptions are fulfilled:
        (1) The power spectrum is Leahy-normalized
        (2) There is no source of variability in the data other than the
