Reporting Issues
****************

While using Stingray or going through its codebase, if you find any bug
please report it. The preferred way to do that is to create a new issue on
the Stingray `GitHub issue page
<http://github.com/stingraysoftware/stingray/issues>`_.
You can also the discuss the issue on our `mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spectraltiming-stingray>`_.
Please include an example that demonstrates the issue that will allow the
developers to reproduce and fix the problem. You may be asked to also provide
information about your operating system and a full Python stack trace; the
Stingray developers will walk you through obtaining a stack trace if it is
necessary.
