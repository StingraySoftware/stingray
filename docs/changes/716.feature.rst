Phase Dispersion Minimization as a method to search for periodic signals 
in data is now implemented in the ``istingray.pulse`` submodule. To use it, 
you can use the ``phase_dispersion_search`` function in 
``stingray.pulse.search``. The accompanying statistical tests are located 
in the ``stingray.stats`` module, under ``phase_dispersion_probability``, 
``phase_dispersion_logprobability`` and ``phase_dispersion_detection_level``.
