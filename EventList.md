Hello! It looks like you want to modify the EventList.read method in the stingray.EventList class to work with Fermi/GBM data. Here are some steps you can follow to accomplish this:

Import 
```
astropy.io.fits 
```
to read in the FITS file format of Fermi/GBM data.

Use 
```
astropy.io.fits.open() 
```
to open the FITS file.

Use the 
```
astropy.io.fits.getdata()
```

function to retrieve the data from the correct table in the FITS file.

Parse the metadata correctly, such as the start time, stop time, and time resolution, from the FITS header. You can use astropy.io.fits.Header to access the header information.

Use the retrieved data and parsed metadata to create an instance of the stingray.EventList class.

Return the 
```
stingray.EventList 
```
instance.

Here's some sample code to give you an idea of what the implementation could look like:



```
from astropy.io import fits
from stingray import EventList

def read(self, filename):
    with fits.open(filename) as hdul:
        data = hdul[1].data
        header = hdul[1].header
        # Parse the metadata, such as start time, stop time, and time resolution
        start_time = header['TSTART']
        stop_time = header['TSTOP']
        dt = header['TIMEDEL']
        # Retrieve the time column from the FITS table
        time = data['time']
    # Create an instance of the EventList class with the retrieved data and parsed metadata
    ev = EventList(time, mjdref=start_time, dt=dt, tseg=(stop_time - start_time))
    return ev
    ```
